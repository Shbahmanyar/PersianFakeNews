# A Novel Content-based Approach for Fake News Detection using Transformer Model: A Case Study of Covid-19 Dataset

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project "A Novel Content-based Approach for Fake News Detection using Transformer Model: A Case Study of Covid-19 Dataset". This repository contains the code and resources used in our research.

## Overview

This project presents a novel content-based approach to fake news detection using a Transformer model. We applied this method to a dataset related to Covid-19, achieving significant results in identifying fake news with high accuracy. The core of our approach leverages the capabilities of Transformer models to analyze the content and determine the veracity of news articles.
